# Explanation of the Code

This Python script is designed to set up and configure a Flask web application with logging, database integration, user management, and route handling. Here's a breakdown of its components:

## Importing Modules

The script imports several Python modules and packages:
- `os`: For interacting with the operating system, such as environment variables.
- `logging`: Enables detailed logging for debugging and monitoring.
- `Flask`: A micro-framework for building web applications.
- `Flask-Login`: Manages user authentication and sessions.
- `SQLAlchemy`: ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interactions.
- Various custom modules and blueprints from the `app` package.

## Logging Setup

The logging module is configured to:
- Log messages at the DEBUG level or higher.
- Format log messages with timestamp, severity level, and message content.
- Write logs to both a file (`app.log`) and the console.

## Blueprint Registration

The script uses blueprints to modularize the app into separate components:
- `public_bp`: Routes for public access.
- `user_bp`: Routes for authenticated user functionality.
- `admin_bp`: Routes for administrative tasks.

## Flask Application Factory

The `create_app()` function is an application factory that:
1. Instantiates a Flask app.
2. Configures the app using environment variables and pre-defined configurations.
3. Registers blueprints for modular route handling.
4. Initializes extensions like the database (`db`) and login manager (`login_manager`).

## Database Initialization

The database is initialized within the app context, and tables are created if `CREATE_DB` is enabled and no tables exist. The script also uses SQLAlchemy's `text` and `inspect` modules to check database connectivity and inspect the schema.

## User Authentication

The `login_manager` is set up to manage user sessions. The `user_loader` function retrieves user information based on `user_id`, leveraging SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities.

## Functionality Breakdown

### Environment Configuration
```python
env = os.getenv("FLASK_ENV", "development2")
app.config.from_object(config[env])
