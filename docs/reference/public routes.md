# Explanation of the Code

## Purpose
This code defines routes for a public-facing Flask application. The features include rendering the homepage, searching for courses, fetching and displaying course details, and user registration or profile management.

---

## **Modules and Imports**
- **`logging`**: Configured for logging application events such as user actions, errors, and data operations.
- **`Blueprint`**: Used to create a modular structure for public-facing routes.
- **`Course`**: Represents the database model for courses.
- **`PublicService`**: A custom service for fetching public data, such as courses.

---

## **Logging Configuration**
- Configured via `logging.basicConfig` to log messages at the `INFO` level or higher.
- Log format includes timestamp, log level, and message for better traceability.
- Logs are directed to `stdout` using `StreamHandler`, making them compatible with logging tools like AWS CloudWatch.

---

## **Blueprint Definition**
- **`public_bp`**: The Flask Blueprint to group all public routes for modular development.

---

## **Routes Explained**

### **Homepage**
- **`GET` Route**: Renders the homepage by returning the `Homepage.html` template.
- **Logging**: Logs an informational message when the homepage is rendered.

---

### **Search Courses**
- **`GET` and `POST` Route**:
  - Fetches user-provided search parameters (`name`, `price`, or `keywords`).
  - Dynamically builds and executes a query based on input parameters.
  - Fetches search results from the `Course` model.
- **Logging**:
  - Logs the number of results fetched.
  - Logs errors encountered during the query execution.
- **Template**: Renders `Search.html` with search results and parameters.

---

### **List All Courses**
- **`GET` Route**: Fetches and displays all available courses using the `PublicService`.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error page if course data retrieval fails.
- **Logging**:
  - Logs a warning if no courses are found.
  - Logs the total count of courses fetched.

---

### **Course Details**
- **`GET` Route**:
  - Fetches and displays details for a specific course identified by `course_id`.
  - Currently returns a placeholder message (`"Course Detail for {course_id}"`).
- **Logging**: Logs an informational message with the requested `course_id`.

---

### **Register**
- **`GET` and `POST` Route**:
  - Renders a registration page or processes registration forms.
  - Currently returns a placeholder (`"Homepage.html"` template).
- **Logging**: Logs an informational message for rendering or form submission.

---

### **Profile**
- **`GET` and `POST` Route**:
  - Currently under construction with placeholder functionality.
  - Returns the `"Homepage.html"` template.
- **Logging**: Logs an informational message when the route is accessed.

## Key Features Highlighted
1. **Modular Design**: Utilizes Flask Blueprints for grouping related routes.
2. **Logging**:
   - Provides detailed logs for each route, aiding in monitoring and debugging.
   - Logs errors and warnings to identify issues promptly.
3. **Dynamic Query Building**: Enables flexible searching of courses using multiple filters.
4. **Error Handling**: Ensures graceful handling of exceptions, providing fallback responses.
