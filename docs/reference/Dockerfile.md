# Explanation of the Dockerfile

## Base Image
**`FROM python:3.11-slim`**  
Specifies the base image as a lightweight version of Python 3.11. This reduces the image size while providing Python's functionality.

---

## Working Directory
**`WORKDIR /app`**  
Sets the working directory inside the container to `/app`. All subsequent commands will run in this directory.

---

## Dependencies Installation
1. **Copy the Dependency File**:  
   **`COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt`**  
   Copies the `requirements.txt` file to the container's working directory.
2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   **`RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`**  
   Installs Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` using pip without caching to save space.

---

## Entrypoint Script
1. **Copy the Script**:  
   **`COPY entrypoint.sh /app/entrypoint.sh`**  
   Copies `entrypoint.sh` into the `/app` directory.
2. **Make Script Executable**:  
   **`RUN chmod +x /app/entrypoint.sh`**  
   Changes the permissions to make the script executable.

---

## Application Code
**`COPY . .`**  
Copies all files and directories from the project folder into the container's `/app` directory.

---

## Exposing Port
**`EXPOSE 5000`**  
Opens port 5000 for external access, which is where the Flask application will run.

---

## Environment Variables
**`ENV PYTHONPATH=/app`**  
Defines the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable so Python can locate the application code.

---

## Conditional Entrypoint
**`ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/sh", "-c", "if [ \"$ENV\" != \"development\" ]; then /app/entrypoint.sh; else echo 'Skipping entrypoint script in local environment'; fi"]`**  
This command runs the `entrypoint.sh` script only if the `ENV` environment variable is not set to `development`. Otherwise, it logs that the script is skipped in a local environment.

---

## Command to Run Application
**`CMD ["python", "run.py"]`**  
Specifies the default command to execute the Flask app:
- **`python run.py`**: Runs the `run.py` script to start the Flask application.

---

This Dockerfile serves as a blueprint to containerize a Flask application. It sets up dependencies, prepares the environment, and ensures the application is executed correctly. The file is optimized for both development and production use cases.
