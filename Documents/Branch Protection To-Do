25/01/2025 - Some branch protection tasks are outstanding due to not having permissions to edit the repository settings:

1) In Settings > Branches, add new Branch Protection Rules (one each for dev and main):

in both rules:
- Require pull request
  - 2 approvers
  - Require review from Code Owners
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Block force pushes

2) Add the other project members to the CODEOWNERS file

3) Enable Dependabot scanning of Github actions (optional) - this monitors the actions workflows for stale or dangerous actions dependencies (e.g. marketplace actions)

4) Create SonarQube Cloud free acccount (up to 5 users) and create project there and hook up the Github action to use this
