25/01/2025 - Some branch protection tasks are outstanding due to not having permissions to edit the repository settings:

1) In Settings > Branches, add new Branch Protection Rules (one each for dev and main):

- Require pull request:
    - 2 approvers
    - Require review from Code Owners
- Require conversation resolution before merging
- Block force pushes
- Require status checks to pass:
    - branch naming: both (use the applicable workflow - dev or main)
    - hard-coded secrets: main only
    - sonarqube scan: main only
    - unit tests: main only
    
2) Add the other project members to the CODEOWNERS file

3) Enable Dependabot scanning of Github actions (optional) - this monitors the actions workflows for stale or dangerous actions dependencies (e.g. marketplace actions) Security > Enable Dependabot Alerts

4) Create SonarQube Cloud free acccount (up to 5 users) and create project there and hook up the Github action to use this

5) Create 'Staging' and 'Prod' environments in Settings > Environment, and assign approvers (should be everyone)
